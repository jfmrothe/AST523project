- replace all floats by doubles?
x make sure that everybody invoking a random function calls srand(time) before -> resolved by starting all execution in a central main that calls srand(time)
- ask Johnny & Chelsea whether partitioning into files makes sense if cross-linking is needed, and whether the defines in the headers are sensible
x where to define ellipsoid-class? -> extra .hh, .cc file pair!

- whats the difference between #include <...> and "..." ?
- add gsl_vector/matrix_free for each ...alloc ? -> did so on 13/12/20
- where to #include time, math, stdio, stdlib ?

- central definition of pi?
- why did sampleellipsoid sigsegv when passed by value?

- multiple define of cluster.hh, vector from multinest.cc and cluster.cc
- FMI: running kmeans with high k (19) is liable to create empty groups
- make sure I understand why/not condition F(S)>1 is satisfied by EllipsoidalPartitioning -> it is satisfied, by enlarging E so that V(E)>=V(S). This is a good thing to do, in order to not lose parts of the iso-likelihood-enclosed volume.
- understand why/how to enforce lower limit of D+1 points per Ellipsoid (this could avoid total splintering)
