Ideas for the next steps ahead - 2013/12/13

Nested Sampling phase:
Johannes continues building the ellipsoid-treating functions inherent to MultiNest, especially EllipsoidalPartitioning and DrawSample
Johnny implements the Lighthouse example for Nested Sampling

Ellipsoidal Sampling phase:
When Johnny is done with Nested Sampling, and Johannes FindEnclosingEllipsoid, we will implement EllipsoidalSampling and test with some monomodal toy problem

MultiNest phase:
This leads to a working configuration of the functions MultiNestDriver, InitializeEverything, RandomSampler and CheckForStoppingCrit from Johnny, which can be coupled to MultiNest's DrawSample, CheckForClusteringCrit, EllipsoidalPartitioning and EllipsoidalScaling functions supplied by Johannes
